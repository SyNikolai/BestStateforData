Working with data has been a cornerstore of every successful organization for the past decades. Breakthrough changes in computational
power and the evergrowing data flow that feed the productivity of our modern society, however, keep emphasizing the need for  talented individuals
who possess the required skillset when dealing with the challenges of large databases.
