# Introduction

In this project, using exploratory data analysis, datasets containing meaningful features concerning salaries in the I.T. industry of the U.S. will be
used, in tandem with cost of living indices as well as tax rates on income per state. Goal of the project is to come up with a confident answer on the ideal state
for a Data related career. 

### DataSets

The fist of the datasets that will be considered during the following analysis, contains valuable insights in terms of job listings in online job markets, such as Glassdoor (datamined during the summer of 2020).

The second dataset, is a collection of various indices (timeframe 2022) that will help in determing the overall cost of living per U.S. state.

Finally, a table containing the current (2022) effective tax rate on income per U.S. state is taken into account.
